// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.
// There is no need to change any of the code.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:

// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2023"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: This will give you the length of how long the value is for the constant cohort which is 10
// b) Verify and explain: .length is the function that counts the length of an index where console.log puts it into action.

// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: undefined
// b) Verify and explain: The answer was o.  The 4 represents the index that is being defined but the [] represent letters and not words which is what I thought.

// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Ruby will be displayed
// b) Verify and explain: This is looking for the specified index in the const languages, and since that index is 1, Ruby is the answer.

// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: This would kick out an error code 
// b) Verify and explain: .toUpperCase does not work with arrays, and since the const is an array, it would not recognize it.

// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: Array 4
// b) Verify and explain: The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand's value which in this case is number.
